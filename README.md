Greetings whoever is looking at this readme file.

# Issue
From what I observed in organising a Business Matching session, the main downfall is not the quality of the matching two appropriate businesses together,
but it seems the pattern is that participants tend to forget their meetings or they are late to their meetings.

# My Solution
Therefore I decided to write a program, in collaboration with Twillio, to send a reminder SMS message customised to the participants' timetable
in order to remind them to turn up to their events. The result was amazing since the turn up rate became 100%. I used this program for the
Think Asia, Think Hong Kong campaign 2017 in London.
